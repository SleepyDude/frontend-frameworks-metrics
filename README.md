# A Living Collection of Frontend Frameworks

A place where frontdevs can keep up to date with their marvelous frameworks. [See](https://blinpete.github.io/frontend-frameworks-metrics/).


It uses [GitHub GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) to fetch the following data:
- `logo`
- `website`
- `stars` count
- `forks` count
- `open issues` count
- `open PRs` count
- `commits` count (on default branch)
- `latest release` label and time
- `languages` dominants
- `createdAt` time
- `updatedAt` time


GitHub workflow fetches the fresh data every night (at 00:00 UTC) and deploys the app to GitHub Pages.
